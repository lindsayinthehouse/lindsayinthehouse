    <h2>Where I study</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I am currently in my second year pursuing my Ph.D. in <b>astronomy</b> at University of Texas (UT)&nbsp;Austin.
      </li>
      <li>
        I recently completed a B.S. in <b>physics</b> at University of North Carolina (UNC)&nbsp;Greensboro.
      </li>
      <li>
        I also have a B.A. in <b>applied mathematics</b> with a concentration in <b>biochemistry</b> from UNC&nbsp;Asheville.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where I work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        During the summer of 2020, I worked at the <b>University of Colorado Boulder</b> developing an online astronomy curriculum for Fiske Planetarium and Partnerships for Informal Education in the Community after-school program. 
      </li>
      <li>
        I previously worked as an <b>adjunct instructor</b> at Wake Tech Community College where I taught a pre-curriculum calculus course. 
      </li>
      <li>
        One of my favorite roles was being a <b>presenter</b> and <b>navigator</b> for <b>planetarium shows</b>, and host the <a href="https://moreheadplanetarium.org/programs/youth-family-programs/science-stage">Science Stage</a>, at UNC Chapel Hill’s Morehead Planetarium and Science&nbsp;Center.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 2018 I was a <b>high school math teacher</b> at Leesville Rd. High School in Raleigh, North&nbsp;Carolina, where I taught Honors Math II and III.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have been a <b>teaching assistant</b> for introductory astronomy and for human&nbsp;anatomy.
      </li>
      <li>
        I worked as an <b>executive assistant</b> at Triangle Kids Pediatric Dentistry. I specialized in community <b>outreach</b> and <b>marketing</b>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I research</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I conduct <b>physics and astronomy education&nbsp;research</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
       My most recent research as a graduate student at UT Austin has been designing and launching a world wide citizen science project called <b> Dark Enery Explorers</b> which classifies millions of galaxies from the <a href="https://hetdex.org/">Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX)</a>. 
       As a part of HETDEX I am working to develop the largest map of the universe ever produced and uncover the mystery of Dark Energy through citizen science.

        I recently presented the following&nbsp;<b>posters</b>:

        </dl>
      </li>
        
      </li>
        Also at UT Austin, I am a part of a team who is developing curriculum and a pre/post assessment tool to gauge the effectiveness of how climate change is taught at the university level across all disciplines. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In summer 2019 I partook in a research experience for undergraduates program at <b>University of Colorado Boulder</b>.  I performed a <b>research study of my own design</b> in which I created, piloted, evaluated, and <b>compared two interactive activities</b> (a lecture tutorial and whiteboard problems) for teaching stellar occultations to introductory astronomy students <b>within the&nbsp;planetarium</b>.
        <!--  <a href="">Read more</a> or <a href="">see the activities</a> and the accompanying pre/post survey.-->
