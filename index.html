						<p style="font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 12px;">As creator of  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/erinmc/dark-energy-explorers">Dark Energy Explorers</a>, I currently use citizen science in combination with machine learning to enhance the  <a target="_blank" href="https://hetdex.org/">Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment </a> while simultaneously bringing the general public the opportunity to participate in astrophysics research. As a part of HETDEX at McDonald Observatory, we are working to create one of the largest maps of the universe ever which will help to narrow down our theories on dark energy.</p>
						<p style="font-size: 14px;">I am also involved in Astronomy Education Research. I have specialized in developing materials for teaching climate change and interactive instruction for teaching within a planetarium dome. The later was in collaboration with Fiske Planetarium and the Physics Education Research group at CU Boulder</p>

During the summer of 2022, I was an astronomy intern for the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (NASM) in Washington D.C. where I worked under the director of education and visitor services. At NASM, I developed hands-on activities to explain dark energy to visitors of the museum and worked on a team to develop a new astronomy citizen science exhibit that will be in the museum in 2025. This exhibit will have the potential to impact the Air and Space Museum’s millions of visitors every year.</p>

						<h2>A little bit more about me</h2>
						<p style="font-size: 14px !important; font-family: sans-serif;">I was born and raised in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains of Western North Carolina. I attended the University of North Carolina at Asheville, earning a BS in Mathematics and later a BS in physics. My passion for education was born at UNC Greensboro as I worked as a Teaching Assistant for an introductory astronomy class. I have exercised my skills as an educator by working with individuals one-on-one tutoring to teaching pre-calculus and courses on the growth mindset at Wake Tech Community College. Additionally, I worked as a planetarium presenter at the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center, where I experienced the joy and privilege of watching children's faces light up as I showed them the vastness of the universe for the first time. These experiences, among others, motivated me to hybridize my greatest passions - astronomy and education, and thus gain my Ph.D. at UT Austin. I have become ever confident in my decision to gain my Ph.D. as it has led me to experiences such as working at the Smithsonian National Air and Space museum in Washington D.C. during the summer of 2022. </p>
						<p style="font-size: 14px !important; font-family: sans-serif;">When my head isn't in the stars, I enjoy hiking, baking, crafting, and traveling. I return home multiple times a year to the NC mountains to enjoy the town's vibrant collection of micro-breweries, take a break from the Texas heat, spend time with family, and put some miles on my hiking boots. For anyone with a trip to Asheville, NC, in the future, be sure to ask me for my list of recommendations - I will happily share my curated Google Doc full of hometown knowledge!</p>
