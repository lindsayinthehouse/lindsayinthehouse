# Hi there! I'm Lindsay House ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒŸ **Visit my website**: [https://lindsay.house](https://lindsay.house)

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a PhD astronomer who spends my days trying to understand one of the universe's biggest mysteries - dark energy - while also working to share the wonder of space with everyone.

## Who I Am

I'm currently a Postdoctoral Preceptor at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute and a researcher at the NSF-Simons SkAI Institute. But what really gets me excited is my work as the creator of [Dark Energy Explorers](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/erinmc/dark-energy-explorers), a NASA Zooniverse project where anyone can help me classify galaxies and contribute to real astrophysics research!

The passion behind all my work is making cutting-edge astrophysics accessible and digestible to the general public, in a way that brings out the inner kid in all of us. 

## What You'll Find Here

### My Research Journey
I'm part of something pretty incredible called the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) at McDonald Observatory. We're creating one of the largest maps of the universe ever made! This map will help us understand how fast the universe is expanding and narrow down our theories about dark energy.

What makes my research special is that I combine citizen science with machine learning. Through Dark Energy Explorers, I've had almost 4 million galaxy classifications from 11,000 volunteers in over 85 countries. Yes, real people like you are helping me do real science!

### Teaching & Sharing Knowledge
I teach at both the University of Chicago and City Colleges of Chicago, covering everything from introductory astronomy to data science and machine learning. I absolutely love teaching and have integrated my passion for public education into my research.

I've also created educational materials and facilitated workshops for K-12 teachers nationwide through McDonald Observatory. If you're an educator interested in incorporating dark energy into your classroom, you'll find resources here that I hope will be helpful!

### Science Communication Adventures
I think sharing my research and excitement about space with the public is just as important as doing the research itself. I've been featured on NPR, CBS, NBC, and NASA, and I've written for SCIENCE Magazine, Astronomy Magazine, and many others.

During summer 2024, I spent four months at Adler Planetarium and Zooniverse as an NSF intern, completely dedicated to science communication. I'm always looking for new, interesting ways to communicate science!

### Leadership & Advocacy
Something I'm really passionate about is making sure people of all racial, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds can not only be exposed to STEM but also be a part of it. I serve on the American Physical Society's Executive Committee for Public Engagement, and I've even represented APS in Congress, advocating for increased funding for science.

I was also part of the leadership team for Astronomy on Tap in Austin, which consistently brought around 200 people together each month to talk about space over drinks!

## Beyond the Stars

When my head isn't in the stars, I love hiking, biking, baking, crafting, and traveling. I'm originally from the beautiful NC mountains (shout out to Asheville!), and I return home multiple times a year to enjoy the fall colors, spend time with family, and put some miles on my hiking boots. 

If you're ever planning a trip to Asheville, definitely ask me for recommendations - I have a curated Google Doc full of hometown knowledge that I'm always happy to share!

## Want to Explore the Universe with Me?

The coolest thing about Dark Energy Explorers is that when you participate, you're literally the first person to see these galaxies, stars, meteors, and black holes! It's like being an explorer in the truest sense.
