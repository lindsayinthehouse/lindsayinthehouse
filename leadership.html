							<h2>Leadership</h2>
							<p>Beyond research, I'm deeply driven to lead in education, public engagement, and science communication—finding ways to connect with kids, students, and curious minds of all ages, and making science feel exciting, relevant, and within reach.</p>

										<h3>Leadership Highlights</h3>
										
										<h4><strong>Executive Committee for APS Public Engagement</strong></h4>
										<p>I currently serve on the American Physical Society's executive committee for public engagement. As a part of this committee, we put together an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aps.org/about/governance/statements/public-engagement">APS wide statement</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18851">white paper</a> on how to center public engagement within the field of physics. I represented APS in Congress, advocating for science funding.</p>
										
										<h4><strong>Choir Leadership</strong></h4>
										<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.choircollaboration.com/home">The choir</a> is a growing ensemble of astronomers who place equal emphasis on understanding the evolution of galaxies across multiple scales and improving our scientific systems. We center intersectionality and value interdisciplinarity through tangible support and initiatives led by our collective of scientists. We are humans first and astronomers second; in both of these roles, we serve as stewards of education, justice, and the co-creation of knowledge and community. Through the support of Heising-Simons, in July 2025, we hosted our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.choircollaboration.com/2025-conference">inaugural</a> conference, inviting astronomers from around the world to Acadia National Park to foster their scientific growth and cultural engagement.</p>
										
										<h4><strong>Intern at Adler Planetarium and Zooniverse</strong></h4>
										<p><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.zooniverse.org/2025/01/08/skies-stories-and-participatory-science-my-adler-zooniverse-nsf-intern-experience/">Read my full blog on Zooniverse here</a> - At Adler/Zooniverse, my work spanned written, spoken, and visual modes of communication, including producing social media content, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.zooniverse.org/2024/10/04/an-educators-guide-to-our-group-engagement-tools/">video materials for educators</a>, and public science programs. One aspect I helped develop was an interactive component to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/explore/exhibits/space-visualization-lab/">Astronomy Conversations</a> program to let museum guests engage with Zooniverse citizen science and continue exploring topics like asteroids at home. I also served as a consultant astronomer for a children's book to ensure scientific accuracy while preserving imaginative storytelling, and I grew substantially in my science‑writing skills, sharing niche astronomy topics with general audiences in outlets like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.astronomy.com/author/lindsay-r-house/">Astronomy Magazine</a>.</p>
										
										<h4><strong>Intern at Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum</strong></h4>
										<p>During the summer of 2022, I was an astronomy intern for the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (NASM) in Washington D.C., where I worked under the director of education and visitor services. At NASM, I learned how the museum operated by managing over 400+ docents from scheduling to daily staff briefings. In addition, I developed hands-on activities to explain dark energy to the museum visitors. I worked on a team to create a new astronomy citizen science exhibit that will be in the museum in 2025. This exhibit will have the potential to impact the Air and Space Museum's millions of visitors every year.</p>
										
										<h4><strong>Co-Founder of Astro Grad Congress</strong></h4>
										<p>Born from a dot.Astronomy conference, <a target="_blank" href="https://astro-grad-congress.github.io/about/">Astro Grad Congress</a>, aims to bring together astronomy graduate students from across the United States to promote interdepartmental discourse. We believe that positive change can come from sharing experiences or resources and gaining broader perspectives. Our goal is to facilitate communication in between early-career scientists and collect, gather, and centralize information to enhance accessibility to knowledge.</p>
										
										<h4><strong>Co-Host Astronomy on Tap</strong>, Austin, TX</h4>
										<p>I have also co-hosted <a target="_blank" href="https://astronomyontap.org/locations/austin-tx/">Astronomy on Tap</a> in Austin, one of the largest groups in the country, consistently drawing ~200 participants each month!</p>
										
										<h4><strong>Researcher at Fiske Planetarium and CU Boulder</strong></h4>
										<p>Working under Fiske Planetarium director John Keller, I began to learn the structures of a large informal education center. This piqued my interest to explore the museum and planetarium space further, one I don't see myself leaving anytime soon!</p>
